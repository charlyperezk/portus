## Portus: A Modular, Hexagonal Service Framework

**Portus** is a lightweight and powerful framework for building reusable, decoupled services using a hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture. It provides a flexible lifecycle system for CRUD operations, validations, transformations, triggers, and logging via hook orchestration.

---

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clear separation between business logic (ports) and infrastructure (adapters).
- **Hook Orchestrator**: Simple, async-compatible executor for validations, transformations, triggers, and logs.
- **Composable & Reusable Hooks**: Built-in hooks like validators, related field setters, hashers, etc.
- **Context-Aware Internal Data**: Easily enrich your domain data with contextual or related fields.
- **Async & Decoupled Execution**: Perform side effects (emails, logs, metrics) cleanly and safely.

### üîÅ Recent Refactor Highlights

**Previous Version**:
- Depended on `LifeCycle`, `CompositeHook`, and nested lifecycle logic.
- Service logic was tightly coupled with hook management.

**Current Version**:
- Uses a centralized `HookOrchestrator` for managing lifecycle logic.
- Introduces a declarative and functional model:
  - `DataValidatorHook`
  - `DataTransformerHook`
  - `DataTriggererHook`
  - `LogCompositorHook`
- Simpler `CRUDService` with rich context merging and DTO enrichment.
